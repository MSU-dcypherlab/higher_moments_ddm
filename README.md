# higher_moments_ddm
This repository contains MatLab and R code for the numerical computation of error rate and  the first three conditional and unconditional moments on decision times for the drift-diffusion model and the extended drift 
diffusion model for two alternative forced choice tasks. 

These codes accompany the paper: 
V. Srivastava, P. Holmes and P. Simen. Explicit moments of decision times for single- and double-threshold drift-diffusion processes. Journal of Mathematical Psychology. conditionally accepted.
